# PyRecover
A Python and PHP based system to recover and log passwords from Chrome.

# Requirements
- Python 3.x.
- A webserver with PHP installed.
- Various Python dependancies (you can see them in the main script.)
- PyInstaller

# Current Status
Currently, a very crude backend has been finished and the actual recovery script is nearly done.

# How to use this program
- Clone the repo and upload the files in the "Site" folder to your website.
- Run the python script and build a recovery file.
- Run the recovery file on the computer you desire to recover the passwords of and check your website.

# Future plans
- GUI for the builder
- Better backend with a login system
- Support for multiple uploads (right now it only lets you have one data file.)
