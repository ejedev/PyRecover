# PyRecover
A Python and PHP based system to recover and log passwords from Chrome.

# Requirements
- Python 3.x.
- A webserver with PHP installed.
- Various Python dependancies (you can see them in the main script.)
- PyInstaller

#Current Status
Currently, a very crude backend has been finished and the actual recovery script is nearly done.

#Future plans
- GUI for the builder
- Better backend with a login system
- Support for multiple uploads (right now it only lets you have one data file.)
